        <h2>LEARNING WITHOUT LIMITS</h2>
        <div class="doIt">
          <p>
            At the elementary level (ages 6 to 12), students developmentally
            shift from building their <span class="boldTx">personality</span> and understanding the concrete
            world around them to <span class="boldTx">finding their place in the world</span> and
            understanding <span class="boldTx">why things are the way they are</span>. Their growing power
            to reason and their imagination become the fuel for their learning. Their social need to be with others drives their desire 
            to work together and to work in groups that have leaders, rules, and a sense of moral order.
            Not only are they learning significant academic
            content at this age, but they are learning so much about what is
            <span class="bold500">right</span> and <span class="bold500">wrong</span>, <span class="bold500">fair</span> and 
            <span class="bold500">unfair</span>. Check <a href="admissions.html"
              >admissions</a
            > for tuition and other details.

        <h2>CURRICULUM GOAL</h2>
        <div class="curriculumPoints">
          <div>
            <h4>Academic Curriculum</h4>
            <p>
              In the lower elementary years (ages 6 to 9), students work with
              the carefully designed Montessori materials to understand
              concepts. As they move into their upper elementary years (ages 9
              to 12), students are can able to understand concepts that are more
              abstract and depend less on the materials to build their
              understanding of new topics. They are more able to work on <span class="bold500">complex
                projects</span> and research to <span class="bold500">expand</span>, <span class="bold500">demonstrate</span>, and 
                <span class="bold500">share their
                  knowledge.</span>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Social &amp; Development Curriculum</h4>
            <p>
              Our social curriculum focuses on supporting students in learning how to care and manage conflicts with others and appreciating differences
              as well as 
              <!-- how to care, how to manage conflict with others, appreciating and
              celebrating differences, and working together for the good of the
              community. The skills students  -->
              have the opportunity to practice
              and shape in the elementary years are ones that strongly influence
              their success as adults: <span class="bold500">independence</span>, <span class="bold500">emotional intelligence</span>, a
              <span class="bold500"></span>love of learning, <span class="bold500"></span>viewing mistakes and 
              “failures” as <span class="bold500">opportunities</span>
              to learn and grow, perseverance, and <span class="bold500">confidence</span> in their abilities
              and ideas.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Co-curricular Classes</h4>
            <p>
              Elementary students enjoy weekly classes in art, music, and
              physical education. These classes are taught by teachers who
              specialize in those areas. The art curriculum focuses on
              appreciating each student’s <span class="bold500">abilities</span> and exploring with form.  Our music
              curriculum includes 
              <span class="bold500">experiencing their music</span>, <span class="bold500">reading music</span>, and 
              <span class="bold500">using the voice</span>. Older students (9 to 12-year-olds) begin some instrument
              work. The physical education curriculum is a favorite where
              students enjoy unique games and activities that help them learn good
              <span class="bold500">sportsmanship</span> and <span class="bold500">teamwork</span>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Learning Beyond the Classroom</h4>
            <p>
              We want the children to be <span class="bold500">comfortable</span> navigating the world, not
              just our classroom. The children must ‘go out’ beyond the limits
              of the classroom to find the information or resource that they
              need. A <span class="bold500">‘Going Out’</span> is a planned undertaking by teachers and
              students. They find a resource in the community and prepare themselves for the experience. 
              <!--  schedule the
              outing, arrange for transportation and supervision (by staff or
              parent volunteers),   -->
              Each Going
              Out is an entire course of study on <span class="bold500">independence</span>, <span class="bold500">responsibility</span>,
              and <span class="bold500">good citizenship</span> — to say nothing of the intellectual rewards
              that children get from going on such an experience.
