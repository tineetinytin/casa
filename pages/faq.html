            <h4>Do you have a phase-in period for new students?</h4>

            <p>
              Before the first week of school, our Teachers and Associate
              Teachers will schedule a home visit to get to know your child in a
              familiar and comfortable space. Following the home visit, children
              and parents are invited to visit their classroom, which helps
              children orient to the new environment. After the classroom visit,
              new students attend school for abbreviated blocks of time working
              up to their full-day schedule over time. The toddler's parents
              stay in the classroom on the first day. On subsequent days they
              drop off at the classroom door and stay nearby should a child need
              a shorter day. Most children adapt quickly to the school day and
              their day is extended at a rate that works for them.

          <div>
            <h4>How many children are in each classroom?</h4>

            <p>
              Toddler classrooms have a maximum of 12 students with two
              teachers. Primary classrooms have a maximum of 22 - 24 students
              with two teachers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Can my child nap at school?</h4>

            <p>
              Yes. All full-day Toddlers nap in the afternoon from 12:15 pm up
              to 2:30 pm. Primary is flexible; children who still nap sleep in
              the afternoons, while those who remain awake engage in educational
              activities. Naptime for Primary students is from 12:45 pm up to
              2:15 pm.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Does my child need to be potty trained to attend?</h4>
            <p>
              Toddler students do not need to be potty trained. Our teachers
              help promote toileting independence and self-care throughout the
              toddler year. In our Primary program, we encourage children to be
              potty trained (or very close to it!) by the beginning of the
              school year.

            <h4>Does the school provide lunch?</h4>
            <p>
              Parents have the option of enrolling in our lunch program directly
              through our catering service, Little Green Gourmets. Little Green
              Gourmets delivers warm and healthy lunches to the school daily.
              Alternatively, parents may send in a nut-free lunch from home.

            <h4>What happens when my child is accepted?</h4>
            <p>
              When families receive an acceptance notification, the enrollment
              agreement and a $10,000 tuition deposit are due within seven days
              from the notice of acceptance. We are unable to hold a seat for
              your child if the agreement and deposit are not paid within the
              acceptance deadline.

            <p>
              The admission process for international applicants is the same as
              for other students except that instead of an initial school
              interview we schedule a Zoom interview. Acceptances are
              conditional until the family completes their move to the USA and
              participates in an in-person follow-up interview.

            <h4>What is the exmissions process?</h4>
            <p>
              Our school exmissions process is a shared responsibility of the
              Head of School and the student’s family. The Head of School meets
              with each family to discuss appropriate options and explain how
              the process works. Throughout the year, they are in communication
              with the on-going schools and with the parents of the applicants.
              We host evening information sessions to review the process for
              both independent schools and New York City’s Gifted and Talented
              Program.

        <h2>MONTESSORI FAQ'S</h2>
        <div class="faqContainer">
          <div>
            <h4>What is the history of Montessori education?</h4>
            <p>
              The Montessori method of education was founded in 1907 by Dr.
              Maria Montessori, the first woman in Italy to become a physician.
              She based her educational methods on scientific observation of
              children’s learning processes. Led by her discovery that children
              teach themselves, Dr. Montessori designed a “prepared environment”
              in which children could freely choose from several developmentally
              appropriate activities. Today, nearly a century after Maria
              Montessori’s first Casa dei bambini (“children’s house”) in Rome,
              contemporary researchers continue to find strong connections
              between the Montessori approach and healthy social, emotional, and
              academic child development.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>
              What is the difference between traditional education and the
              Montessori approach?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Montessori emphasizes learning through all five senses. Children
              in Montessori classes learn at their own pace and according to
              their developmental trajectory. Teachers carefully select lessons
              to present to each child based on his or her developmental stage.
              Each lesson nurtures a specific set of skills and is designed to
              be practiced independently or in small groups. Montessori schools
              place children in mixed-age classrooms, forming communities in
              which the older children share their knowledge with the younger
              children. They feel an immense sense of pride being able to teach
              a lesson to a younger child and be a role model for appropriate
              behavior and social skills.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>What is the Montessori curriculum?</h4>
            <p>
              In the Toddler Half and Full Day classrooms, Practical Life
              activities allow children to engage in daily adult-like
              activities, such as sweeping, folding, or setting a table.
              Toddlers practice Self-Care, learning to button, zip, and snap,
              take off and put on their shoes, and successfully use the toilet.
              The Toddler environment is rich in Language: thoughtful
              conversation, songs, and rhymes accompany a wide range of
              materials designed to enrich vocabulary. Manipulative materials
              for Sensory-Motor Development encourage refinement of hand-eye
              coordination. Gross- Motor skills are developed through activities
              including rhythmic music, movement, and outdoor play. Children
              also explore musical instruments and artistic media that cultivate
              Self-Expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Primary Full Day classroom, Practical Life activities help
              children refine their sense of order, concentration, independence,
              and coordination while they pursue purposeful activities such as
              table washing, flower arranging, polishing objects, and buckling
              shoes. Grace and Courtesy activities allow the children to
              practice social skills to successfully navigate many complex
              situations with ease. Sensorial activities isolate qualities such
              as color, texture, weight, and shape, encouraging children to
              experience and explore the world through their senses. Children
              learn to sort, match, and grade, making meaningful connections to
              the environment. Language activities introduce phonetics and
              writing, providing children with opportunities to sound out
              sentences and stories. Math manipulatives introduce children to
              the concept of the decimal system and the four operations of
              addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Through
              working with these concrete materials, concepts come alive and
              make a deep impression on the brain. In the broad Cultural area,
              children are introduced to puzzle maps of the continents, animal
              and plant kingdoms, and classifications. Art and music are
              integrated into the daily routine to encourage self-expression and
              creativity. Children learn songs, use rhythmic instruments, and
              engage in art projects using varied materials.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>How is the Montessori classroom arranged?</h4>
            <p>
              The environment is arranged in work centers according to the
              subject area. Subjects are integrated such that math, language,
              science, history, geography, art, and music are all present in the
              classroom. Children are free to move around the room instead of
              staying at desks. Children work on rugs or at tables either in
              pairs or independently. Cooperative work and community building
              are essential components of the Montessori classroom.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>
              Are there opportunities for movement and play in a Montessori
              classroom?
            </h4>
            <p>
              A hallmark of the Montessori method is that children move freely
              about the classroom during their work periods. Movement is an
              essential component of many of the activities. Students may
              transition from activity to activity at their own pace, with
              support from their teacher. Children work on the floor, at tables,
              standing, and in chairs at different points throughout the day. At
              the Montessori Schools-Flatiron &amp; SoHo, children also engage
              in structured and free play on the indoor or outdoor play space
              daily.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>
              How will my child be assessed and evaluated in a Montessori
              classroom?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The teacher, through extensive observation and record-keeping,
              designs individual lesson plans that enable each child to learn,
              improve, and approach lessons that are challenging enough to
              promote interest and learning but not so challenging that they are
              discouraging. Teachers generate narrative reports that describe
              each child’s developmental progress through the year. Disciplinary
              issues are approached using a collaborative problem-solving
              method, rich with language and communication.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>
              Are Montessori children successful at ongoing traditional schools
              and later in life?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Research studies show that Montessori children are well prepared
              for later life academically, socially, and emotionally. In
              addition to scoring well on standardized tests, Montessori
              children are ranked above average on such criteria as following
              directions, turning in work on time, listening attentively,
              showing responsibility, asking provocative questions, showing
              enthusiasm for learning, and adapting to new situations. Research
              has shown that Montessori materials and the structure of the
              classroom help children develop higher-level executive functioning
              skills that are clear indicators of school readiness and future
              success. These skills include the development of impulse control,
              working memory, task persistence, grit, problem-solving, creative
              thinking, and managing time, workspace, and resources.

          <div>
            <h4>What special training do Montessori teachers have?</h4>
            <p>
              All lead teachers at The Montessori Schools-Flatiron & SoHo have
              their Montessori Certification. Training includes teaching
              apprenticeship, child observation, and coursework covering
              principles of child development, Montessori philosophy, and
              Montessori materials.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>How can I use Montessori techniques at home with my child?</h4>
            <p>
              Look at your home through your child's eyes. Children crave a
              sense of both belonging and independence, and they feel this by
              participating fully in the routines of everyday life. "Help me do
              it by myself" is often a preschooler’s mantra. Find ways for your
              child to participate in meal preparation, cleaning, gardening, and
              caring for clothes, shoes, and toys. Follow your child's interest
              and avoid interrupting her when she is engrossed in an activity.
              In school, only a trained Montessori teacher can properly
              implement Montessori education using the carefully designed
              materials in a Montessori "prepared environment." Social
              development comes from being in a positive and unique environment
              with other children – an integral part of Montessori education.
